## 🎯 Today's Goals
-  Understand the basic structure and routing of [Laravel 12.x](https://laravel.com/docs/12.x)
-  Set up MongoDB with Laravel using laravel-mongodb package [Laravel-mongodb](https://www.mongodb.com/ko-kr/docs/drivers/php/laravel-mongodb/current/quick-start/view-data/)
-  Test basic CRUD operations with MongoDB inside a Laravel controller

## 📚 What I Learned
-  Laravel shares similarities with Django in its MVC structure and clear folder organization, which made it feel familiar
-  The php artisan command-line tool makes it quick and efficient to generate migrations, models, and controllers
-  I installed the laravel-mongodb package and successfully connected it to MongoDB
-  Tested basic CRUD operations: storing documents, fetching data, and applying filters using Eloquent-style queries
-  Laravel 12 uses a new bootstrap process; bootstrap/app.php is more streamlined
-  laravel-mongodb package provides an easy way to use MongoDB as an Eloquent-compatible database
-  Collections in MongoDB behave differently compared to MySQL tables—schema-less structure gives more flexibility but requires clear data handling in code

## 💡 Reflections
-  Although I'm new to Laravel, my experience with modern frameworks like Django helped me adapt quickly
-  As a PHP developer, it felt surprisingly comfortable—Laravel fits naturally with the language I'm familiar with
-  While integrating MongoDB was interesting, what impressed me most was Laravel itself
-  I had the feeling that this framework is strong enough to build real, solid projects—it gave me confidence to consider developing with it seriously
-  The MongoDB integration felt smoother than expected thanks to the laravel-mongodb package

## 🛠 Tomorrow's Plan
-  Practice modeling nested documents and relationships in MongoDB
-  Try out Laravel’s authentication features
-  Build a simple form to submit and retrieve data using MongoDB

## 🧠 Free thoughts
-  I’m getting more comfortable with Laravel’s structure
-  Laravel feels like “the Django of PHP” with its structured and modern approach
-  It’s reassuring to see that PHP can still be used for clean, modern development
-  I'm starting to consider whether I can bring Laravel into future real-world projects
