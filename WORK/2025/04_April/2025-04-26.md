## ðŸ“š What I Learned
-   The `bind()` method
-   [React] How function and class components work internally

## ðŸ’¡ Reflections
-   It was a solid hands-on day building a super minimal React clone! 

## ðŸ›  Tomorrow's Plan
-   React & Redux practice
-   Start working on a React project

## ðŸ§  Free thoughts
-   I think it's interesting to explore a bit more about what's going on under the hood.



### The Core Idea: `bind()` fixes the value of `this`

First, let's understand how `element.appendChild()` works. It is a method that appends a **child node** to a specific **DOM element**:

js

CopyEdit

`element.appendChild(childElement);`

In this case, `childElement` is added as a child of `element`. This works as expected when called directly on the `element`.

### The Issue with `forEach` and `this`

Now, here's the issue: when you're using `forEach` or any array method that uses a callback function, the value of `this` inside that callback is not automatically bound to the object you're calling the method on. Instead, the value of `this` will be set based on how the callback is executed.

#### Example of the problem:

js

CopyEdit

`const element = document.createElement('div');
const child = document.createElement('span');

// This works fine because `this` is `element`
element.appendChild(child); // This works correctly

// But if we use forEach, `this` might not be `element`
const children = [child]; // A list of child elements
children.forEach(element.appendChild); // This will throw an error!`

In the above code, we try to call `appendChild` inside `forEach`, but because `forEach` is not bound to the `element`, the `this` inside `appendChild` won't be `element`. As a result, the method doesn't behave as expected.

### Why is `bind()` Necessary?

The `bind()` method is used to **fix the value of `this`** in the `appendChild` function, ensuring that `this` always refers to `element`, regardless of where the function is called.

### How `bind()` Works

js

CopyEdit

`node.children.map(createDOM).forEach(element.appendChild.bind(element));`

-   **`node.children.map(createDOM)`**: This creates an array of DOM elements from the `children` nodes.

-   **`.forEach(element.appendChild.bind(element))`**: This iterates over each child and calls `appendChild` for each of them.

    -   **`bind(element)`** ensures that **`this`** is always set to `element`, even inside the `forEach` callback.

Without `bind()`, `this` would point to the context in which `forEach` is running, and `appendChild` would fail because it wouldn't have the correct `this` value.

### Why is `bind()` Important?

When we use `forEach`, the callback function is executed in a new context. In this case, that means `this` would be set to `undefined` or to the `forEach` method itself, which is not what we want. By calling **`element.appendChild.bind(element)`**, we are explicitly ensuring that every call to `appendChild` will have `element` as the correct `this`, so it can append the child elements correctly.

### Simple Example to Demonstrate

js

CopyEdit

`const element = document.createElement('div');
const child = document.createElement('span');

// Bind `appendChild` to `element` so it always knows `this` should be `element`
const appendChildToElement = element.appendChild.bind(element);

// Now we can use `appendChildToElement` with the correct `this` value
appendChildToElement(child); // The child is correctly added to `element``

### In Summary

-   **`bind()`** is used to **fix the value of `this`** to a specific object, which ensures that methods like `appendChild` behave as expected when called inside callback functions (like `forEach`).

-   By using `bind(element)`, we guarantee that `appendChild` will always be executed with `element` as the `this`, ensuring the child nodes are appended correctly.
