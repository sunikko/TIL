## ðŸŽ¯ Today's Goals - Day off
-   Start TIL ðŸ™Œ
-   Finish migrating from Vanilla JS to TypeScript and submit the PR
-   Start working on a React project
-   Review Django a bit

## ðŸ“š What I Learned
-   `Currying*` is a technique used in functional programming

## ðŸ’¡ Reflections
-   Backend logic feels more interesting when I focus on clean architecture
-   I'm really getting into TypeScript and React, and I'm loving them

## ðŸ›  Tomorrow's Plan
-   TIL
-   React & Redux practice (which I'm currently loving)

## ðŸ§  Free thoughts
I recently built an AIrecorder app with React Native, which sparked my interest in making apps and diving into React & TypeScript. Since I started my career with typed languages rather than scripting ones, TypeScript and class-based models are really fun to explore.\
I'm also interested in integrating the GPT API. While there are lots of examples using Python with FastAPI, I'd like to give it a try too ðŸ˜‚ ..Django?ðŸ¤”.. Gotta pace myself though, Soy!


### What is Currying?

Currying is a technique used in functional programming where a function, which takes multiple arguments, is transformed into a series of functions, each taking a single argument. This allows you to call the function step by step, providing one argument at a time, rather than all of them in one go.

### Is Currying Commonly Used?

Currying is a commonly used technique in **functional programming languages** such as **Haskell**, **Scala**, and **Clojure**, where functions are treated as first-class citizens and are often composed in various ways. In **JavaScript**, currying is also widely used, especially when dealing with higher-order functions (functions that return other functions).

While currying is not a concept native to all programming languages, it is very popular in languages that support functional programming paradigms.


### Example in JavaScript with Arrays

Currying can also be useful when working with arrays. It allows you to create reusable functions that can process data in a more flexible manner.

```
const filterGreaterThan = threshold => arr => arr.filter(x => x > threshold);

// Partial application
const filterGreaterThan5 = filterGreaterThan(5);
console.log(filterGreaterThan5([1, 2, 6, 7, 8]));  // [6, 7, 8]

```

In this example, we define a curried function `filterGreaterThan` that filters numbers greater than a certain threshold. We then create a specific function, `filterGreaterThan5`, by applying `5` as the threshold. This makes it reusable for any array we want to filter.

### Advantages of Currying

1.  **Code Reusability**:

    -   Curried functions can be reused with different arguments. For example, `multiply(2)` can be reused multiple times, only changing the second argument.

2.  **Partial Function Application**:

    -   You can apply some arguments to a function now and supply the remaining arguments later, making the code more flexible and easier to compose.

3.  **Lazy Evaluation**:

    -   Currying can support lazy evaluation, meaning functions are only evaluated when necessary, which can optimise performance.

4.  **Fits Well with Functional Programming**:

    -   Currying is very useful in functional programming, where functions are designed to be pure, meaning they do not have side effects, and can be easily composed with other functions.
